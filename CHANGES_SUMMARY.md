## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)
- Modern alternative to sinusoidal position encoding
- Better relative position awareness
- Used in state-of-the-art models like LLaMA

**Usage:**
```python
model = TransformerTTS(..., pos_encoding_type='rope')
```

### 2. SwiGLU Activation
- Gated activation mechanism for FFN layers
- Improved gradient flow and convergence
- Better representation learning

**Usage:**
```python
model = TransformerTTS(..., activation='swiglu')
```

### 3. Temperature Sampling
- Control generation diversity in inference
- Trade-off between quality and variation

**Usage:**
```python
mel = model.greedy_generate_fast(enc_ids, temperature=1.2)
```

### 4. TTSMonitoring Module
Complete monitoring suite including:
- Alignment extraction and visualization
- Alignment quality metrics (diagonality score)
- Gradient analysis (detect vanishing/exploding)
- Adaptive gradient clipping (3 strategies)
- Metrics aggregation over time
- SNR computation for mel-spectrograms

**Usage:**
```python
from TTSMonitoring import (
    extract_alignment_from_model,
    compute_alignment_diagonality,
    visualize_alignment_matrix,
    analyze_gradients,
    adaptive_gradient_clipping,
    MetricsAggregator
)
```

### 5. Modern Model Presets
Ready-to-use configurations:
- `modern_small`: 6 layers, 512 dim, RoPE + SwiGLU
- `modern_base`: 8 layers, 512 dim, RoPE + SwiGLU  
- `modern_large`: 12 layers, 768 dim, RoPE + SwiGLU

**Usage:**
```python
from TTSConfig import get_model_preset
preset = get_model_preset("modern_base")
```

## Backward Compatibility

**100% backward compatible** - all existing code works without modification:

```python
# Old code - still works perfectly
model = TransformerTTS(
    num_layers=8, d_model=512, num_heads=8, dff=2048,
    input_vocab_size=1000, n_mels=80
)

# New code - with modern features (optional)
model = TransformerTTS(
    num_layers=8, d_model=512, num_heads=8, dff=2048,
    input_vocab_size=1000, n_mels=80,
    activation='swiglu',
    pos_encoding_type='rope'
)
```
